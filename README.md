# Agent Web Interface

An MCP server for browser automation that exposes semantic, token-efficient page representations optimized for LLM agents.

---

## Motivation

LLM-based agents operate under strict context window and token constraints.
However, most browser automation tools expose entire DOMs or full accessibility trees to the model.

This leads to:

- Rapid token exhaustion
- Higher inference costs
- Reduced reliability as relevant signal is buried in noise

In practice, agents spend more effort _finding_ the right information than reasoning about it.

Agent Web Interface exists to change the unit of information exposed to the model.

---

## Core Idea: Semantic Page Snapshots

Instead of exposing raw DOM structures or full accessibility trees, Agent Web Interface produces **semantic page snapshots**.

These snapshots are:

- Compact and structured
- Focused on user-visible intent
- Designed for LLM recall and reasoning, not DOM completeness
- Stable across layout shifts and DOM churn

The goal is not to mirror the browser, but to present the page in a form that aligns with how language models reason about interfaces.

---

## How It Works

At a high level:

1. The browser is controlled via Puppeteer and CDP
2. The page is reduced into semantic regions and actionable elements
3. A structured snapshot is generated and sent to the LLM
4. Actions are resolved against stable semantic identifiers rather than fragile selectors

This separation keeps:

- Browser lifecycle management isolated
- Snapshots deterministic and low-entropy
- Agent reasoning predictable and efficient

---

## Benchmarks

Early benchmarks against Playwright MCP show:

- **~19% fewer tokens consumed**
- **~33% faster task completion**
- Same or better success rates on common navigation tasks

Benchmarks were run using Claude Code on representative real-world tasks.
Results are task-dependent and should be treated as directional rather than absolute.

## What Agent Web Interface Is (and Is Not)

### Agent Web Interface is:

- A semantic interface between browsers and LLM agents
- An MCP server focused on reliability and efficiency
- Designed for agent workflows, not test automation

### Agent Web Interface is not:

- A general-purpose browser
- A visual testing or screenshot framework
- A replacement for Puppeteer

Puppeteer remains the execution layer; Agent Web Interface focuses on representation and reasoning.

---

## Usage

Agent Web Interface implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and works with:

- Claude Code
- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- VS Code
- Any MCP-compatible client

Example workflows include:

- Navigating complex web apps
- Handling login and consent flows
- Performing multi-step UI interactions with lower token usage

See the `examples/` directory for concrete agent workflows.

## Claude Code

```bash
# Basic (auto-launches browser)
claude mcp add agent-web-interface -- npx agent-web-interface@latest

# With auto-connect to your Chrome profile
claude mcp add agent-web-interface -- npx agent-web-interface@latest --autoConnect

# Headless mode
claude mcp add agent-web-interface -- npx agent-web-interface@latest --headless
```

## CLI Arguments

The server accepts the following arguments to configure browser initialization:

| Argument                 | Description                                                     | Default          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `--headless=true\|false` | Run browser in headless mode                                    | `false`          |
| `--browserUrl`           | HTTP endpoint to connect to existing browser                    | -                |
| `--wsEndpoint`           | WebSocket endpoint to connect to existing browser               | -                |
| `--autoConnect`          | Auto-connect to Chrome 144+ via DevToolsActivePort              | `false`          |
| `--isolated`             | Use isolated temp profile instead of persistent                 | `false`          |
| `--userDataDir`          | Chrome user data directory                                      | Platform default |
| `--channel`              | Chrome channel (chrome, chrome-canary, chrome-beta, chrome-dev) | `chrome`         |
| `--executablePath`       | Path to Chrome executable                                       | -                |

### Automatic Browser Initialization

The browser is automatically launched or connected on the first tool call. No explicit initialization is needed.

Examples:

```bash
# Auto-launch visible browser (default)
npx agent-web-interface

# Launch headless browser
npx agent-web-interface --headless

# Auto-connect to Chrome with remote debugging enabled
npx agent-web-interface --autoConnect

# Connect to specific endpoint
npx agent-web-interface --browserUrl http://localhost:9222
```

## Using Your Existing Chrome Profile (Chrome 144+)

To connect with your bookmarks, extensions, and logged-in sessions:

1. Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` in Chrome
2. Enable remote debugging and allow the connection
3. Use `--autoConnect` CLI argument

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-web-interface": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-web-interface@latest", "--autoConnect"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                                        | Default     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `AWI_TRIM_REGIONS` | Set to `false` to disable region trimming globally | `true`      |
| `CEF_BRIDGE_HOST`  | CDP host for browser connection                    | `127.0.0.1` |
| `CEF_BRIDGE_PORT`  | CDP port for browser connection                    | `9223`      |

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lespaceman/agent-web-interface
cd agent-web-interface
npm install
npm run build
```

Configure the MCP server in your client according to its MCP integration instructions.

## Architecture Overview

Agent Web Interface separates concerns into three layers:

- **Browser lifecycle** — page creation, navigation, teardown
- **Semantic snapshot generation** — regions, elements, identifiers
- **Action resolution** — mapping agent intent to browser actions

This separation allows each layer to evolve independently while keeping agent-visible behavior stable.

---

## Status

Agent Web Interface is under active development.
APIs and snapshot formats may evolve as real-world agent usage informs the design.

Feedback from practitioners building agent systems is especially welcome.
